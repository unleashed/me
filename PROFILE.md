# Summary

Born Sep 1980 - First program 1988. First C program 1994. First Linux install
1995. First graphics demo (demoscene) 1996. Very experienced engineer who has
worked in a whole lot of fields, from security and networking (tuning,
programming, admin) in highly sensitive environments (think critical government
facilities, traffic management systems, etc) to Linux distributions, embedded,
kernel drivers, file systems, high level applications (ie. artifical vision),
video playback, P2P networking, PKI, virtualization (QEMU), flash storage,
web backends, SaaS, APIs, system administration, devops and distributed systems.

In general my career has been based in and around free software and Linux/UNIX
operating systems. I am particularly strong in low level systems, but have been
working with the whole spectrum of software, including maintaining and porting
legacy systems for years and modern web stacks.

With over 12 years of accumulated professional experience added to over 15 more
as a computer programmer, I have consistently been referred to as "overachiever"
and "key asset".

If you look for someone that has experience with free software, that has been
a team leader in several projects, who has experience as interviewer and team
management, and who can respond with hands on experience about:

- "why does this my program return garbage when I run it on ARM vs x86?"
- "why did the data I sent over the network before closing a connection never
   reach my peer?"
- "why is my code calling a library function that just jumps to another function
   right away?"
- "why is my lock-free algorithm slower than the comparable one with locks when
   I run it on my 8-way machine?"

...as well as:

- "why is it next to useless to check the average values of response times?"
- "why is it recommended that I use composition over inheritance?"
- "why should you always extract aspects from functions/methods?"
- "why is my collision detection algorithm for rotated shapes so slow?"

...and, definitely most importantly:

- "why should I stop referring to free software as 'opensource'?"
- "why should I stop waging zealot wars?" :)

...then you probably found a good candidate.

# Current interests

- Linux kernel, OS design, hardware, virtualization & containerization plumbing
- PLT and in particular Idris and Rust programming languages
- All things gamedev and 3D

# Remarkable Experience

  - experience writing drivers
  - experience backporting, testing & tuning filesystem code (F2FS particularly)
  - committed a series of small patches in mainline

- Research project: SELinux Mandatory RBAC & Play Machine (2004)

- Specialised in Networking and Secure Coding (2004)

- Contributions in free software:
  - Part of the Core Team of the aMule P2P client.
  - Google Summer of Code (2006)
    - Made *BSD port of Gentoo possible by fixing sandboxing libc issues
    - Contributions in FreeBSD kernel and userland.
      - Bugfixing a hard lock in devfs kernel filesystem
      - Made "mkdir" POSIX compliant
  - OpenMOSIX Single System Image kernel (Linux-based clustering)
  - F2FS
  - GNU Autotools

  - QEMU
  - Courier SASL Auth
  - Puma Web Server
  - Rubinius VM
  - A whole lot others I just can't remember anymore.

- Father of the StormFly USB dongle (2012-2013)
  - Encrypted USB based on Debian or Ubuntu bases with extra packages
  - Tuned F2FS implementation for performance and low flash memory wearing
  - Powerful build system for Debian-derived distros

- Designed networking video monitoring and playback software for underground and
  train networks in Barcelona.

- Wrote UHF-to-TCP/IP mesh transport network for remote telecommand units
  deployed in areas with accessibility issues (ie. dam remote control in a
  mountaineous zone) using UHF and TETRA radios.
